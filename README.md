Objective: Create a Pets app

Deliverables:

MODELS:

<!-- - Owner has a first name, last name, age, and email -->
<!-- - Owner has many pets -->
- Pet has a name and type (dog, cat, or bird)
- Pet belongs to a User

CONTROLLERS AND VIEWS:
- User can do full CRUD on an Owner
- User can do full CRUD on a Pet
- Owner and Pet index pages link to show page
- Custom route allows users to see all Owners with 2 or more pets


VALIDATIONS:
- There cannot be duplicate Owners (unique first names)
- Owners must be older than 18
- Pet cannot be added if the type is not a dog, cat, or bird
- User sees a message to verify that a Pet/Owner was successfully, or unsuccessfully, created
